# Self-Organizing Maps for Process Mining in the Energy Sector

This repository contains the implementation of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for clustering process flows within the Meter-to-Cash (M2C) process of an energy company. The goal is to identify non-standard and problematic cases by preprocessing event log data from an SAP system and analyzing the results through SOM.

Research Questions

* How does the number of features influence the identification of clear clusters using SOM?
* Can SOM effectively identify clusters in real-world M2C data that represent both standard and non-standard/suspicious behavior?
